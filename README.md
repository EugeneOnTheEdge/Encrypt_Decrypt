A little software to encrypt / decrypt a string. The program is based on Python.
Please note that the program is still in beta and there are probably tons of bugs (please let me know them if you find any :) )You can also see how inefficient the code is, but I'm workin' on it!
Also, the program creates a new file called 'logED.dat' the first time you run it--that's where the datas are located and please make sure that it is in the directory where the main program is.
